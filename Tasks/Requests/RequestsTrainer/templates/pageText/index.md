Being able to manipulate HTTP requests, (and read the responses) is an
important skill.

If we can manipulate the data that is sent to a web server, we may be
able to modify its behaviour.

This Trainer will let you play with HTTP requests and their responses.

## Topics

The Trainer covers two main topics

  - Requests

    Will let you look at, and play with standard HTTP requests.

  - Sessions

    Sessions and Cookies give us a way of sending data back
    to the server. This means that we can maintain some state across a
    stateless HTTP session.


## Structure of the Trainer

The trainer has two components

  - Tasks
  - Challenges

### Practice

Help you practice the skills taught in the module.
The topics covered by teach task  should correspond to the course material, and the demo / lab tasks
given.

### Challenges

You can test your skills with the challenges.

Each task, or topic, will have a corresponding challenge.
Each challenge will let you demonstrate your understanding of the task topics.

Unlike Tasks the answer will not be given in the practical sessions,
you may need to use your wider understanding of the topic (or google) to finish them.
